A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
Linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
Each node of a list is made up of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node
has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list.
It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node.
If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.

Each node has at least:
1) Data
2) Pointer to the next node
*In Java and Python, Linked List can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class.
**The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type.
