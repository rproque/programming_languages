1) What is a class
A class is a template for an object.  An object has attributes such as data or methods.
Think of a class as the blueprint for a vehicle.  A vehicle has characteristics
and things you can do with them.
-Characteristics:
--color, number of doors, type of vehicle, number of wheels, transmission type
-Methods:
--park, neutral, reverse, 2/4wheel drive, roll down window, lock, unlock, open/close

Defining a class of car helps us to create objects of type car.  Each object will then have
consistent characteristics and methods names.

2) Defining a class
class AppClass:
    '''This is a docstring'''
    pass

7) Classes are dynamic
-instance variables can be made on the fly
